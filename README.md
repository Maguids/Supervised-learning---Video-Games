# Supervised Learning - Video Games Dataset

This project was focused on the video game dataset, required **data exploration**, **creation of new features**, and **pre-processing** (treatment of missing values, normalization, etc.). The goal was to **train and evaluate two supervised classification algorithms** (Decision Trees and K-NN) to predict the average user rating (bad, mediocre, good or great), comparing the results with metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
It was developed for the "Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science" course.

## Requirements:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

<br></br>

## Work Developed:
- **Problem Formulation**;
- **Data Analysis**;
- **Data Preprocessing**;
- **Exploratory Analysis**;
- **Classification** - in this fase we made several tests, in each test we did the following:
	- Data Configuration;
	- Data Division;
	- Decision Tree;
	- KNN;
	- Cross-Validation (except in test 1);
	- Assess the Importance of Variables;
- **Comparison of Results**;
- **Parameter Tunning**;
